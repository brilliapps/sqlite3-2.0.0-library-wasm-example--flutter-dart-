# sqlite3 2.0.0 wasm example (flutter/dart)
 A working example of sqlite3 wasm for web. It was done with sqlite3 v. 2.0.0. flutter 3.10.4, windows 11, device chrome, it uses print method so you do not need to use --debug option. hot reload and and hot restart (r, and R) insert a row to an existing database, so it works.
